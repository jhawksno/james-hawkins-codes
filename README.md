# JamesHawkins.Codes

This is my personal portfolio and blog about coding. This site is currently being built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

_It is a work-in-progress and may contain bugs and layout issues._
